# Iris Dataset Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data analysis and classification techniques using the famous **Iris Dataset**. The project leverages Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

### Steps Included

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - View the dataset's structure and summary statistics.
   - Visualize the relationships between features using scatter plots and other visualization tools.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Train several machine learning models using `scikit-learn`, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
     - Gaussian Naive Bayes
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajwalsable99/Machine-learning-Example-Iris-Data
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
cd iris-classification
jupyter notebook iris-classify.ipynb
```

3. Execute the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project is a well-known dataset available publicly. It is included in the repository as `Iris.csv`. If unavailable, you can download it from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Results

The project evaluates multiple machine learning models to determine the best-performing classifier for the Iris dataset. The results are visualized and summarized in the notebook.
